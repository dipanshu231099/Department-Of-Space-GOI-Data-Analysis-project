Increasing the yield efficiency is a requirement that is very difficult to
pursue manually, as it requires manual effort and a considerable time
window to see the results. Hence, we try to build a model (based on
Deep Learning) that can carry out the process many times faster and
without the involvement of any real time queries on the processes. All we
require is the data collected, pertaining to parameters and objects, prior
to carrying out the processes/unit steps. However, the proposed model
can only be applied on a single process for its optimisation.

For the purpose of data storage, the tool SQL Management Server 2014
was used. The data analysis was carried out in a python environment
with some of the very helpful python3 libraries to carry out data science
algorithms in an elegant and efficient manner.

A detailed explaination can be seen in the `final_report.pdf`.
